            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian
            origin, but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for
            their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are
            made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with
            butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled
            into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
            results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
            Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
            crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have
            long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and
            pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
            century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
            pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be
            freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the
            La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast
            food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French
            bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
